# Goal

The goal of the this project is to create a banking app in order to help me understand app development in QT and ultimately software development. This is also for other students who wish  to learn different aspects of software development, namely UI Development, SQL, Unit testing and so on.

## Procedure

This application is developed using the  'The incremental model'. In short a simple version of the software will be completed first then new features will be added overtime.
The file "Docs" contains notes on how the software is structured namely sequence diagrams, UML diagrams and notes explaining the different concepts used.

### Contents

The folder "Docs" contains notes on how the software is structured namely sequence diagrams, UML diagrams and notes explaining the different concepts used.
The folder "Core" contains the back-end part of the application and the folder "Ui" contains the front-end part of the application.

Different aspects of software development(using the Qt framework) that I will consider are:

- Parsing XML
- Validation and Regex
- Concurrency
- Design Patterns
among others.

Use the "Create database tables.txt" file to create database tables for the application.
